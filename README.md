# Welcome to the RaBe ISRC Working Group

We aim to be the primary contact toward improving everything related to how we
consume, and interact with ISRC/ISO 3901 identifiers at RaBe. This including
keeping relevent resources pertaining to ISRC identifier available and
facilitating working with ISRC codes across the industry.

This Working Group is hosted by the [RaBe IT-Reaktion](https://rabe.ch).
